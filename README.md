# Codeforces-Language-Finder

Project Description: Codeforces Language Finder
Overview: The Codeforces Language Finder is a web application designed to analyze the programming languages used by a given Codeforces user. By leveraging the Codeforces API, this tool fetches the user's submissions and displays their preferred languages in a visually appealing pie chart. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring an intuitive interface and modern design elements.

Key Features:

Input User's Codeforces Handle:

A simple form allows users to enter their Codeforces username (handle) to analyze their programming history.
Data Visualization:

Displays the distribution of programming languages used by the user in a dynamic pie chart created with Chart.js.
Up to 30 unique colors are supported for a visually diverse and engaging chart.
Responsive Design:

The application is fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Error Handling:

Provides meaningful error messages if the user handle is invalid, the API is unavailable, or no submissions are found.
User Experience:

Features a clean, modern design with smooth animations, hover effects, and gradient backgrounds for a professional look.
Technical Details:

Frontend Technologies:

HTML5: Markup for structuring the web page.
CSS3: Advanced styling, including gradients, shadows, and responsive design.
JavaScript (ES6): Handles API interactions, processes data, and renders the Chart.js graph.
Chart Library:

Chart.js: A powerful JavaScript library for rendering the pie chart with user data.
API Integration:

Codeforces API is used to fetch user submission data (https://codeforces.com/api/user.status).
How It Works:

Users enter their Codeforces username in the form and submit the query.
The app retrieves the user's submissions from the Codeforces API.
It processes the data to calculate the frequency of each programming language.
The results are displayed in a pie chart, showing the proportion of each language.
The most-used language is highlighted in the result message.
Use Cases:

Codeforces Users: Analyze their language usage to understand their preferences and strengths.
Educators and Mentors: Help students analyze their coding habits.
Competitive Programmers: Gain insights into trends and diversify their programming skills.
Enhancements: This project demonstrates the integration of APIs with front-end technologies and showcases creative design skills. It can be extended further by:

Adding Bar Graphs: Display languages used over time.
User Leaderboard: Compare language preferences among different users.
Dark Mode Support: Provide a toggle for light and dark themes.
Export Options: Allow users to download charts or share results.
This project is an excellent showcase of web development skills, including API handling, responsive design, and interactive visualizations.
